# Multithreaded Web Server in C

This project is a lightweight, multithreaded web server implemented in C. It leverages multithreading to handle multiple client requests simultaneously, ensuring efficient handling of concurrent connections.

## Features

- **Multithreading**: Capable of handling multiple requests concurrently by spawning threads for each client.
- **LRU Cache**: Implements an LRU (Least Recently Used) caching mechanism to store and retrieve frequently accessed content quickly.
- **Simple HTTP Handling**: Supports basic HTTP GET requests.
- **Concurrency Control**: Efficient resource management using thread pooling and mutex locks.
  
## Requirements

- **C Programming **
- **POSIX-compliant system** (Linux/MacOS recommended for socket handling)
- **CMake** (for building the project)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the web server on your local machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ritesh1408/Multithread-Web-Server.git
   cd Multithread-Web-Server
   ```

2. **Build the Project**:
   - Make sure you have CMake installed. Then, run:
     ```bash
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake ..
     make
     ```

3. **Run the Server**:
   - After building, you can start the server by running:
     ```bash
     ./webserver
     ```

### Usage

- By default, the server runs on `localhost` at port `8080`.
- You can access the server from a browser or via `curl`:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:8080
  ```
- The serverâ€™s settings (e.g., port, thread pool size) can be modified in the configuration file or within the source code as needed.

## Project Structure

- `src/` : Contains the main server source code, including multithreading and caching logic.
- `include/` : Header files for the server.
- `tests/` : Test cases to validate server functionality.

## Configuration

- **Port Number**: The default port is `8080`. You can change this in the source code or configuration file.
- **Thread Pool Size**: Adjust the thread pool size based on the expected load for optimal performance.
- **Cache Size**: Customize the LRU cache size depending on the amount of data you expect to serve frequently.
